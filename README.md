# LinkedIn Authentication App

This Ruby on Rails application lets users authenticate with LinkedIn in order to receive the browser code needed to continue with obtaining a LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 token.

The app here is part of the first time setup of the [LinkedIn Orbit Community Integration](https://github.com/orbit-love/community-ruby-linkedin-orbit).
