# LinkedIn Authentication App

This Ruby on Rails application lets users authenticate with LinkedIn in order to receive the token needed to continue with using the app.

The app here is part of the first time setup of the [LinkedIn Orbit Community Integration](https://github.com/orbit-love/community-ruby-linkedin-orbit).
